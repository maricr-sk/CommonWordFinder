# CommonWordFinder
Finds the most common words in a text file and the number of unique words (only occurs once in the file), accounting for invisible chars or otherwise invalid ones. Parses the file and builds a map using AVL Trees, BSTs, and hashmaps. Uses a comparator to sort the map, and uses StringBuilder and BufferedReader. Made to support the Bible and the number of occurrences in the text.
